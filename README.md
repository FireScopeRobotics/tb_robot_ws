# TB_ROBOT_WS

This repository contains some launch files and nodes reponsible for facilitating some operations on board the turtlebot4, including an `led_controller` and nodes responsible for remapping certain topics as well as enabling a centralized docking and undocking service which is compatible with commands sent from the ``swarm`` repository.
